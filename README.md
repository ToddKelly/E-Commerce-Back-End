# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Objective

This repository is on the framework of MySQL queries, Sequelize uses a language of your choice, in this case JavaScript, to make queries and send json data to a database and API calls to a website. Wikipedia defines ORM: "in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. The task was to take existing code and add model code, Sequelize and configure the API routes to make the required queries.
<br>
This program works such that when a user adds a database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable filethen they can connect to a database using Sequelize.
When a user then enters schema and seed commands then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
When the command to invoke the application is entered then the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. 
When the user opens API GET routes in Postman for categories, products, or tags then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When they test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Postman they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.
